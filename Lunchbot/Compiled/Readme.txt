.:: Preparation ::.

  1. Make sure the cursor tip is somewhat exactly
     where Offset 1 is in the screenshot. Hit Q.
  2. Do the same thing for Offset 2, but with W.
     Did I really have to write that?



.:: Usage ::.

  Important: Lunchbot may be too quick for your
             computer. Adjust speed (bottom left)
             using arrow up/down to adjust speed.
             A lower number makes Lunchbot faster.
             A higher number makes lunchbot slower.

  | stops current actions
  1 moves all letters to corner
  2 moves letters from corner to random locations
  3 moves letters about randomly

  Note 1: You may have to hold | for a while.



.:: How to draw an image ::.

  1. Make a new image in MS Paint, size 760x544.
  2. Draw the image using ONLY white and black.
  3. Save the image as a 16-colour bitmap.
  4. Start Lunchbot, click "Browse...", select image.
  5. Make sure all letters are top-left in the game.
  6. Stop all other actions, press 4.

  Note 1: If the program fails, press 4 again - it
          will improve the image.

  Note 2: You may draw using as thick lines as you
          want. The program will balance the use of
          letters automagically. :>
